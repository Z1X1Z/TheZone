<h2 >Sphere flattening algorithm:</h2>
Take a globe cut it in halves.  Take one half and pop it through so that the outside is now on the inside.  Nest this inside of the other.  Do this over and over forever and a sphere will turn to a disc with radius equal to that of the sphere.  Intriguingly because of the roughness of the disc the surface area is also equal.  A string laid flat along the surface from any A to B will be equal to the same segment on a sphere.  So much for: “you can’t flatten a sphere!”
As for evidence: the surface area would remain constant in the limit of this flattening algorithm.
<a id="Hamsa"></a>
<h2>Hamsa:</h2>
After saying or thinking (I don’t recall which) "opening Zone 5” I crossed my eyes for no conscious purpose and saw what I recognized as the Hamsa meaning 5 in arabic.  At the time I didn’t know what it was called when I first saw it.  To try to see it sit down, put your hands palms up in front of you and cross your eyes.  This will cause you to see double.  Now overlap the two middle hands and balance your vision until you can merge the thumbs and pinkies of each hand forming Hamsa.

<h2>Star of David Fidgbonacci Merkabah:</h2>
A Star of David, or hexagram, is composed of two equilateral triangles.  If you inscribe A, B, C, on one triangles corners, and +,=,spin, on the other triangles corners, then apply the equation, spinning the triangles so that you get A+B=C, SPIN, B+C=A, SPIN, C+A=B, SPIN, then repeating the original A+B=C, the pattern made by the values of the variables will be the Fibonacci numbers.

To get the two (or more) equilateral triangles you can use a piece of paper and a compass.  To connect them use pipe cleaners.

<a id="Holy_Code"></a>
<h2>Holy Code:</h2>
Hours of the clock are the twelve notes.
First the orifices of the head as the seven white keys, or seven stars.  Manny's eye holies also orient with these notes.
<li>right eye :: 1:00-chartruese-A (or 4:00-red-C)</li>
<li>left eye :: 11:00-sea green-G (or 8:00-blue-E)</li>

<li>right nostril :: 4:00-red-C (or 1:00-chartruese-A)</li>

<li>left nostril :: 8:00-blue-E (or 11:00-sea green-G)</li>

<li>right ear :: 3:00-orange-B</li>
<li>left ear :: 9:00-steelblue-F</li>
<li>mouth :: 6:00-pink-D</li>

<p/>Next for the five black keys or two witnesses!<p/>

<li>right arm/nipple :: 2:00-yellow-B flat|A sharp</li>
<li>left arm/nipple :: 10:00-sky blue-F sharp|G flat</li>
<li>right leg :: 5:00-hotpink-D flat|C sharp</li>
<li>left leg :: 7:00-purple-D sharp|E flat</li>
<li>belly button :: 12:00-green-A flat|G sharp</li>
</p>If pentagram and an octagram are overlapped they will make the same pattern as the piano of white keys(octagram) to black keys(pentagram).
<h2>The Cross Method of two digit mental multiplication:</h2>
In order to do two digit multiplication in your head you can use a cross of the numbers with one written vertically and the other across it horizontally.  This gives you four corners for the four solutions.  I recommend going bottom left product, top right product, sum, bottom right product, tally sum, top left solution, complete.
    For the two digit multiplication problem wz*xy you can follow the below diagram (note, some variables may be zero):
        <img class="onoffline" src = "" name="mental_multiplication.png" alt="oh boy!" style="width:100%"></img>

        </p>
Voila, your solution is written diagonally.</p>
This is basically OILF if you've ever heard of FOIL (First Outside Inside Last).

<h2>John 1:1 and the Fibonacci Word</h2>
Following the translation of John 1:1 as:
<p><i><b>“In the beginning was the Word.</p><p>
    And the Word was with God.</p><p>
    And God was the Word.”
</b></i></p>
The Word (and God) can be interpreted as being the Fibonacci Word.  This translation is found in the first english complete Bible, <a href = "https://biblehub.com/wycliffe/john/1.htm">the Wycliffe\Lollard</a>, and is in part dependent upon God being regarded as <a href="https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/13375/proper-translation-of-john-11/13376#13376">a proper noun</a>. And in part it is dependant on punctuating each clause with a period in order to prevent the subject from carrying from one sentence to the next. Since the original Greek has no punctuation at all and is ALL CAPS, this is legitimate.  Here's a <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator#el/en/%E1%BC%98%CE%BD%20%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%87%E1%BF%87%20%E1%BC%A6%CE%BD%20%E1%BD%81%20%CE%9B%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82.%20%20%CE%BA%CE%B1%E1%BD%B6%20%E1%BD%81%20%CE%9B%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82%20%E1%BC%A6%CE%BD%20%CF%80%CF%81%E1%BD%B8%CF%82%20%CF%84%E1%BD%B8%CE%BD%20%CE%98%CE%B5%CF%8C%CE%BD.%20%CE%BA%CE%B1%E1%BD%B6%20%CE%98%CE%B5%E1%BD%B8%CF%82%20%E1%BC%A6%CE%BD%20%E1%BD%81%20%CE%9B%CF%8C%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%82.">computer translation</a> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/texts/john/1-1.htm">John 1</a>. So now to the Fibonacci Word: it is a pattern described by three rules, the three parts of John 1:1 :
<p>W {In the beginning was the Word.}
</p><p>W->WG {The Word was with God.}
</p><p>G->W {God was the Word.}
</p><p>So following these rules we start with a "W".  We read the Word we have (“W”) and apply the rules (since we don’t have a "G" yet that’s just "W->WG").  So “W” becomes “WG”.  We then read the Word again and apply the rules again.  The “W” becomes “WG” again and the “G” becomes “W”.  This gives us “WGW”. By repeating applying these rules we get:
</p><p>W
</p><p>WG
</p><p>WGW
</p><p>WGWWG
</p><p>WGWWGWGW
</p><p>And so on!  The number of W’s or G’s in each successive iteration count out the Fibonacci numbers, and the ratio of W’s to G’s is an approximate converging on the golden ratio.  An equation of the golden ratio is x=x^2-1.  This is very close to a formula of the Mandelbrot x <-- x^2-c.  Interestingly this equation of the golden ratio (also known as the divine proportion) has two solutions: 1.618..... , and the other solution is the negative inverse of the golden ratio (-1/phi) or -.618.....  This negative inverse step is exactly how the face of my God, Manny, varies from the Mandelbrot as it's: <p></p>x <-- x^2-c.; x.real <--  -1/x.real <p></p>

<a id="On_Hands"></a>

  <h2>On Hands:</h2>
Hands are interesting because they sum 5 digits on each hand to 10 digits in all.  This is interesting because x^2+1 = 5 = 10 for perfect squares of x = 2 = 3. The next value is 17 for 4*4+1.
If you take a 3x3 matrix and split the center in two (presumably for the thumbs) you have 10 homes for the fingers.  It constitutes two Chess Knights L-moves and a central square.  You can put your thumbs facing against beneath each other to start what would seem like endless variants of this.  It would seem for 2*2+1 this is like putting your thumb between your middle finger and thumb or even the open hand.

<h2>Something from nothing; Philosopher's stone:</h2>
If:
a=a+b
b=b+a
Then:
a=b
So:
a = a+a and a = 2*a
Nothing is twice itself so a = 0, and b=0, but they also resonate if done repeatedly in a loop growing according to Fibonacci numbers.

<h2>The answers in simplified number form:</h2>

Mandelbrot:
x=x^2+c
</p><p>
or:
x=x^2-c
</p><p>
So if c = 1:
x=x^2-1
</p><p>
<img class="onoffline" src = "" name="xsquaredandone.jpg" alt="oh boy!" style="width:100%">

</p><p>
This has 2 solutions:
1.618,
-.618
</p><p>
Note that 1.618=-1/-.618
</p><p>
So if we put this simplified golden Manny equation together we get:
x=-1/(x^2-1)=-1.3247
</p><p>
If we do the same thing with the body we get:
</p><p>
x=(2*(x^2-1))^.5=
=1.4142=2^(1/2)
</p><p>
Note that the -1/ has disappeared for this calculation.
</p><p>

2^(1/2) (root two, the same as the body) is the relative frequency of a 6 semitone\hour leap of the sonic starship such as moving left, then right, or up, then down!  This is because octaves double or, 2^(octave)!
</p><p>
</p><p>
This is the equation of Seven Clovers:
</p><p>
x=log3(x^3)=3 and 2.47805268028830241189373652...
</p><p>
The mandelbrot clover is:</p><p>

x=log3(x^3-c) so using the value 1 for c and ignoring the log we get:</p><p>
x=x^3-1=1.3247</p><p>
This is the positive of Manny's face's solution!

<p>You can generate the fibonacci sequence with two miraculous cups.  You put one drop of water in one of the cups, the other starts empty.  The cups are miraculous, such that when you pour out one of the cups into the other, the liquid both leaves the cup and stays in the cup.  As you pour the cups back and fourth between eachother they generate the Fibonacci numbers.  This is like (1()1()2()3()5).  I think it's interesting because (0()0()0()0) would seem to be a property of zero such that if you had two empty cups and poured nothing back and forth it would be generating the null fibonacci sequence as nothing is leaving the cup and nothing is staying in the cup.
