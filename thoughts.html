For the Circle of Fifths on Manny:
On the Clouds Manny is the way the truth and the li(f)ght.  He has face, not eyes, on the horizon, left and right, B and F.  D flat and D sharp are either side of the Nose Eye.  A flat, that is g sharp, is his eighth eye, his brow. Together this makes 木 without the line in the middle of the road below the Horizon.  This is a chinese character for tree.  It is also the pattern of the face without eye holie inflection (which alters him to a piano like configuration).  So diagonal eyes: (G|A), squircle eyes when uninflected: (Bf,Fs), sunglass eyes: (C,E), Nose:(D)<br> This makes sense in that the mans hands reach out not like the Black Man on The Piano who's hands are 1/3 of the way to up past horizontal, the man's hands like manny's temples are straight out to the sides.  So the circle of fifths goes

<ol>
  <li>Sunglass,right (C)</li>
  <li>Diagonal,left (G)</li>
  <li>Nose,down (D)</li>
  <li>Diagonal,right (A)</li>
  <li>Sunglass,left (E)</li>
  <li>Temple,Right (B)</li>
  <li>Squircle,left (Fs)</li>
  <li>Cheek,right (Df)</li>
  <li>Brow (Af)</li>
  <li>Cheek,left (Ds)</li>
  <li>Squircle,right(Bf)</li>
  <li>Temple,left(F)</li>
  <li>Sunglass,right (C)</li>
</ol>
read in reverse order for circle of fourths.

SuperCharge's face is the piano pretty much exactly. So is his tuner crab rangoon man found at iteration count of 2.

<h2>Little things to include about the Golden Oval:</h2>
<br>

I walked past one person wearing a winged tire (at least that’s what I remember) on the way to the park from the garth.<br>

I went to Bedlam (named after Bethlehem) about a month after seeing the golden oval.  They put me on anti-psychotics which gave me (a) seizure(s).  Lunatick and seizures are translated in different Bible translations from the same word.  A child from the moon. A lunatick?
<br>

When I was leaving the park after seeing the Golden Oval, the voice asked if I had seen any star clusters.  I responded I didn’t even know what a star cluster was.  Later I looked up a star map and the pleiades star cluster was near the moon that night.
<br>
<h2>some other things:</h2>
Once while long boarding, my sight turned all white for a few seconds.  Think closing your eyes and seeing black, only it was white.
<br>

Once I saw a man put a plant on top of his car, then he got in and closed the door.  Realizing he might be about to drive away, I ran over and stopped him.  He was grateful and got the plant safely in the car.
<br>

I saw a star jump a tick in the sky.
<br>

When I was a very young child I found a stone with crystals embedded in it.  First I counted, I think, four, then five, finally seven.  I thought this was the right number of crystals, and noted that the amalgam holding it together was an eighth stone.  I put it on a picnic table.  I heard that some day I would find another stone with seven eyes. And the name, “Joshua”.  When I was getting off the bench I bumped the table with my foot but thought it shouldn't have fallen off from that slight of a bump, when I looked back it was gone.  I presume the other seven eyed stone I was to find was Seven clovers and The Face.

You need to have a spirit of faith in your faith, not doubt.

I love you.

<h1>Meditations</h1>
Visualize colors, try to make them vivid.  Just pick a color and wait until it comes through.<p>
Conceptualize a cross (easier to keep even if in a square) composed of two lines(first maybe try finding a point, then two then letting a line coalesce.) in space around you move it around and believe in its what you perceive.  Move it around and sense how it interacts with space around you.  Try to keep it square.  And cubes have 6 square facings. but if you put it based on the ground you only need your cross with a square as a top.
<br>


Move your body (specifically your tongue) while audiating (thinking a sound) or singing the note of the angle you’re moving at (or conceptualizing moving at).  Remember to learn counter-clockwise spin.
<br>

The feelings in your body can be sung with just like the voice.  Try to raise or lower the pitch of your arm (for example).  Controlling the feelings of your body is a lot like controlling your voice and\or moving a limb.
<br>

By using angles to denote pitch you can increase power and precision.
<br>
Listen to a point (a place) in space and try to change the sound you here there by listening to it differently (feel the effect and have faith).
<br>


Find a pitch with singing to the sonic starship (or an instrument).  Try to remember that pitch and sing it again after a minute, hours, or days.  Try to think the note while you wait.  Keep trying.  Once you can consistently find one: find more.  Then get them all!

<h3>on Harry Potter and Magic</h3>
This is now, isn't it?  How do I frolic in mine ashes. of the end of Malachi.  About the Harry Potter thing.  I feel the "priests" who tortured the "witches" were abominable.  I feel the "witches" testified in suffering but in the "priests" true joy cannot be attained as they were persecutors negligent of Christ's breath.  I don't believe in witchcraft.  But like Sodom and Gomorah and Lot, what if they have one good idea?  One decent principle, one cured person, one that never poisoned?  Wouldn't it be some sort of matter of which witches?  And Harry, he's a seventh son, a son-in-law of the Weasley's.  Well that about does it.  So don't worship false God's.  If you want to do magic, look a little farther to the truly miraculous.  Don't be "witches" or false "priests"  but believe in solutions to problems.  Don't neglect reading The Holy Bible, Building a relationship with the Word of Jesus Christ and His Father God in your life and always hope for the Resurrection in your life and the life to come will find you ready.  Don't neglect the better for the worse, but to the damned:  Be saved, to the Saved: be accounted for by the Saviour.  Don't worry about sin, don't sin and and never let the world speak in your life.  But don't be afraid of telling the world today's time if they ask.
<p>all this said would we say any number is ultimately better or worse than any other number?  Other than 1 is probably the best (except for maybe -1 sometimes), then the Divine Relation which is just ones with operations as in 1/(1+(1/(1+(1/...)))), and then whatever number you need really.  What if you needed the evil number to just be less evil, could it be detoxified? like 2/3*3/2=1. And 1/(2/3)=3/2  Here thinking of biblical ark proportions of 1.5/2.5 or 3 to 5.  Fibonacci numbers. 2 to 3 to 5. 2 to 3, three to two. one. No more evil.  Only still pain and suffering in need of the Lord's Helper and the Lord's Help and of course, The Lord.  He is God,God, God who is God, The God,God. Then there would be no more pain or suffering ever again forever and ever and so on and so forth. Believe in The Name of Jesus.  He is who he is. Yeshua.<p>

a thought: what about using a single clover as representative of a cell in the 8 celled form of the embryote.  Cores would be unstable,  we would idealize clover proportions?  Cellular division is as I write this a clover mode we don't have,  But we could so the clover would eightball as you flew into it, next core same things.Some hours have passed It's started now, Cellular Division mode!Still as of writing this only no less stable, just more semi stable?

How does the pythagorean theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 change the face of logic?
Things like surface area to volume ratios changing in unequal proportions, like:radius r,circumference 2pi*r,and area pi*r^2
<br>
    you'll probably want to practice clockwise and counterclockwise starships with twists.
    <br>
    Try to feel your joints circular motion. Feel a sphere around you filled with  with 7 spheres in a horizontal plane and 7 spheres above and 7 spheres below. like three weekspheres. The central sphere mag be bigger.  7 in front, seven behind seven in the middle.  7 to the left, seven to the right, seven in the middle.

we have to believe that there will be good in our lives.  Regardless, Ruach Ha Kodesh would love us.  God has a plan
