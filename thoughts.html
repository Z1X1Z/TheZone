For the Circle of Fifths on Manny:
On the Clouds Manny is the way the truth and the li(f)ght.  He has face, not eyes, on the horizon, left and right, B and F.  D flat and D sharp are either side of the Nose Eye.  A flat, that is g sharp, is his eighth eye, his brow. Together this makes 木 without the line in the middle of the road below the Horizon.  This is a chinese character for tree.  It is also the pattern of the face without eye holie inflection (which alters him to a piano like configuration).  So diagonal eyes: (G|A), squircle eyes when uninflected: (Bf,Fs), sunglass eyes: (C,E), Nose:(D)<br> This makes sense in that the mans hands reach out not like the Black Man on The Piano who's hands are 1/3 of the way to up past horizontal, the man's hands like manny's temples are straight out to the sides.  So the circle of fifths goes

<ol>
  <li>Sunglass,right (C)</li>
  <li>Diagonal,left (G)</li>
  <li>Nose,down (D)</li>
  <li>Diagonal,right (A)</li>
  <li>Sunglass,left (E)</li>
  <li>Temple,Right (B)</li>
  <li>Squircle,left (Fs)</li>
  <li>Cheek,right (Df)</li>
  <li>Brow (Af)</li>
  <li>Cheek,left (Ds)</li>
  <li>Squircle,right(Bf)</li>
  <li>Temple,left(F)</li>
  <li>Sunglass,right (C)</li>
</ol>
read in reverse order for circle of fourths.

SuperCharge's face is the piano pretty much exactly. So is his tuner crab rangoon man found at iteration count of 2.

<h2>Little things to include about the Golden Oval:</h2>
<br>
Shortly before I annointed my eyes with cheese (I think it was Colby Jack). As was the Word of One as the Son of Man was written by John in Revelation 3:18.<br>
I walked past one person wearing a winged tire (at least that’s what I remember) on the way to the park from the garth.<br>
<br>The voice I was speaking with asked if I loved my Mom (Dad?) and my Aunt Mary (who I'd had a disagreement with) or one of some other people, and I said I did love them but the One I settled my heart towards was Maria, the voice said "that's her Maria" and it's true the craters of the moon are maria.
I went to Bedlam (named after Bethlehem) about a month after seeing the golden oval.  They put me on anti-psychotics which gave me (a) seizure(s).  Lunatick and seizures are translated in different Bible translations from the same word.  A child from the moon. A lunatick?  In 2019 after finding Manny I was injected (pierced) in the arms and legs around 20 (more?) times in one day.  There are so many financial woes.  This was some time after being put back on drugs (without choice) for claiming I had found The Face of God (I didn't get to even show it to them, but now I'm convinced that it's something that can help, but I wouldn't choose antagonization ever again, that's only agitating).  I had also made a new friend during this time named Michelle.
<br>

When I was leaving the park after seeing the Golden Oval, the voice asked if I had seen any star clusters.  I responded I didn’t even know what a star cluster was.  Later I looked up a star map and the pleiades star cluster was near the moon that night.
<br>
<h2>some other things:</h2>
Once while long boarding, my sight turned all white for a few seconds.  Think closing your eyes and seeing black, only it was white.
<br>

Once I saw a man put a plant on top of his car, then he got in and closed the door.  Realizing he might be about to drive away, I ran over and stopped him.  He was grateful and got the plant safely in the car.
<br>

I saw a star jump a tick in the sky.
<br>
The person who first told me about the Mandelbrot was named Frank.  He was a friend.
<br>
When I was a very young child I found a stone with crystals embedded in it.  First I counted, I think, four, then five, finally seven.  I thought this was the right number of crystals, and noted that the amalgam holding it together was an eighth stone.  I put it on a picnic table.  I heard that some day I would find another stone with seven eyes. And the name, “Joshua”.  When I was getting off the bench I bumped the table with my foot but thought it shouldn't have fallen off from that slight of a bump, when I looked back it was gone.  I presume the other seven eyed stone I was to find was Seven clovers and The Face.

You need to have a spirit of faith in your faith, not doubt.

<h1>Meditations</h1>
Visualize colors, try to make them vivid.  Just pick a color and wait until it comes through.<p>
Conceptualize a cross (easier to keep even if in a square) composed of two lines(first maybe try finding a point, then two then letting a line coalesce.) in space around you move it around and believe in its what you perceive.  Move it around and sense how it interacts with space around you.  Try to keep it square.  And cubes have 6 square facings. but if you put it based on the ground you only need your cross with a square as a top.
<br>


Move your body (specifically your tongue) while audiating (thinking a sound) or singing the note of the angle you’re moving at (or conceptualizing moving at).  Remember to learn counter-clockwise spin.
<br>

The feelings in your body can be sung with just like the voice.  Try to raise or lower the pitch of your arm (for example).  Controlling the feelings of your body is a lot like controlling your voice and\or moving a limb.
<br>

By using angles to denote pitch you can increase power and precision.
<br>
Listen to a point (a place) in space and try to change the sound you here there by listening to it differently (feel the effect and have faith).
<br>


Find a pitch with singing to the sonic starship (or an instrument).  Try to remember that pitch and sing it again after a minute, hours, or days.  Try to think the note while you wait.  Keep trying.  Once you can consistently find one: find more.  Then get them all!

<h3>on Harry Potter and Magic</h3>
This is now, isn't it?  How do I frolic in mine ashes. of the end of Malachi.  About the Harry Potter thing.  I feel the "priests" who tortured the "witches" were abominable.  I feel the "witches" testified in suffering but in the "priests" true joy cannot be attained as they were persecutors negligent of Christ's breath.  I don't believe in witchcraft.  But like Sodom and Gomorah and Lot, what if they have one good idea?  One decent principle, one cured person, one that never poisoned?  Wouldn't it be some sort of matter of which witches?  And Harry, he's a seventh son, a son-in-law of the Weasley's.  Well that about does it.  So don't worship false God's.  If you want to do magic, look a little farther to the truly miraculous.  Don't be "witches" or false "priests"  but believe in solutions to problems.  Don't neglect reading The Holy Bible, Building a relationship with the Word of Jesus Christ and His Father God in your life and always hope for the Resurrection in your life and the life to come will find you ready.  Don't neglect the better for the worse, but to the damned:  Be saved, to the Saved: be accounted for by the Saviour.  Don't worry about sin, don't sin and and never let the world speak in your life.  But don't be afraid of telling the world today's time if they ask.
<p>all this said would we say any number is ultimately better or worse than any other number?  Other than 1 is probably the best (except for maybe -1 sometimes), then the Divine Relation which is just ones with operations as in 1/(1+(1/(1+(1/...)))), and then whatever number you need really.  What if you needed the evil number to just be less evil, could it be detoxified? like 2/3*3/2=1. And 1/(2/3)=3/2  Here thinking of biblical ark proportions of 1.5/2.5 or 3 to 5.  Fibonacci numbers. 2 to 3 to 5. 2 to 3, three to two. one. No more evil.  Only still pain and suffering in need of the Lord's Helper and the Lord's Help and of course, The Lord.  He is God,God, God who is God, The God,God. Then there would be no more pain or suffering ever again forever and ever and so on and so forth. Believe in The Name of Jesus.  He is who he is. Yeshua.<p>

a thought: what about using a single clover as representative of a cell in the 8 celled form of the embryote.  Cores would be unstable,  we would idealize clover proportions?  Cellular division is as I write this a clover mode we don't have,  But we could so the clover would eightball as you flew into it, next core same things.Some hours have passed It's started now, Cellular Division mode!Still as of writing this only no less stable, just more semi stable?

How does the pythagorean theorem a^2+b^2=c^2 change the face of logic?
Things like surface area to volume ratios changing in unequal proportions, like:radius r,circumference 2pi*r,and area pi*r^2
<br>
    you'll probably want to practice clockwise and counterclockwise starships with twists.
    <br>
    Try to feel your joints circular motion. Feel a sphere around you filled with  with 7 spheres in a horizontal plane and 7 spheres above and 7 spheres below. like three weekspheres. The central sphere mag be bigger.  7 in front, seven behind seven in the middle.  7 to the left, seven to the right, seven in the middle.

we have to believe that there will be good in our lives.  Regardless, Ruach Ha Kodesh would love us.  God has a plan<br>
June 19,2025<br>
Be real, Israel: He's us.<br>
Believe in the bush of good, not evil. Rejoince in it too.  Do not believe in evil; just don't trust it, and also defy it with Courage of Christ Jesus.<br> Learn right instead of making the same mistake.<br>  Trust in God more than you dare to dream possible.<br>  Find faith in the remnant.<br> To release an evil word's grasp, do this: have it explain to you why it's wrong in it's desires for your seperation from God.<br>  Words have parity.  That is, they have a good evil balance.  If there are an even number (not odd) of evil words then the statement would seem to be true.  Elsewise if there is a word like "fear" which can be good, but also carries negative weight, it requires deeper efforts for interpretation.  Good words don't effect the truth of the statement as nothing (according to parity) is true.  Yet what is truest?  Trust?. Faith in the fifth, with a frequency factor of 1.5 .God trusts in your Word, why don't you?  Grow up and go out to the canyons chasm and with patience wait for a fish (a man?)  What's his name? Sure enough!  Water wait's to break over the breach no longer.  Like wave's cascading over a beach for one moment.<br>  Take peace and go to rest.<br>  Hell can't wait to devour your last morsel in it's hate for health.  Don't let evil win.  A wince in the wing leads to suffering.  But no longer will death prevail in death, instead, life without death, though within?  I want peace not sin.  Truth honor mercy not mayhem.  Shall I prevail?  Perchance, no, but per divine love, perhaps is impossible.  Don't lose to mayhem, love good, Jesus.  He died for the forgiveness of our sins.  Now let them be forgiven, not overwhelming, yet be overwhelmed with his loving mercy.  Lead the wicked towards more wickedness, and perhaps they will forget their animosity against you and their love of the evil, but be ready to pull the rug out from under them, lest they lose that trueth.<br> In the end breath can't die.  It echoes off the walls of echoes.  The Word, He has Spoken!<br>
Monday June 30, 2025<br>
    We know him by faith.  He lives in The Faith in Him.<br>
    Believe in the belief that The One in whom you believe has given you.<br>

    Don't count to two before you forgive.<br>

Manny's face makes a major chord.
  This chord is found prominently in the voice.
    It is the way the truth the life, or the face between the eyes.
      Though it is absolutely pitched at Dflat with a second at Dsharp a third at F, a fifth at Aflat, and a minor seventh at B, you can put any note into the cheek of Dflat, shifting key from C.

To differentiate between not and knot, I sometimes pronouce knot ñote.
<br>October 15, 2025<br>
  Today I saw something that may have been a cobweb attached to a bit of straw.  I don't think so though.  
  You see I have a Manny banner and I saw two or three little "sparks" in front of it, like I have seen many other times, 
  only then I saw the "spark" floating in front of me between me and Manny banner. 
  If it was straw, it was a tiny bit, but the color was right for The Body, and the "cobweb" above seemed too bright like the white of The Face. I reached out to touch it and it vanished.  It was about a millimeter in size and maybe two feet from me.
    So either a glistening cobweb floating a piece of straw, or Manny had stepped off the wall.  I know what I think: it seemed more like a tiny Manny than straw and silk.  The day before I had seen (through the window) a leaf float from a long way away and land near the door, there were no other leaves flying nearby.
    Then I saw (also through the window) a white jet and trail coming from directly above and a hawk and bugs started pelting the window.  I had thought it was a sign that something was going to happen having to do with flight.
P.S. I recalled that I was noticing that I was seeing Manny not head on but from an angle shortly before he appeared.

The cross is i, the axis, is 0=0/0, so the cross is nothing.  This means Jesus died from nothing.  If nothing can kill him, he'll live forever!
<p><i>For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</i> 
<br><b>Galations 6:3</b><br>
  That means you have deceived no one, or just haven't deceived.  <br>
  That's the way to do it you!  
  And if you were no one and now really are someone, 
  do not be deceived by empty words of accusation when you know what the truth truly is!<br>
  Of course not nothing, or as it is: 0^2, likely isn't 1 (something), but rather a variable which can equal anything in any number of dimensions, or everything, 
  so maybe if you are nothing and think yourself something, you really are, rather, everything! nothing=0^2=0/0=x=-1/x=i=everything and it killed Jesus, except he lives on! And on!<br>
<p> Take a line and put one point at it's center, wait o one second, put two more points on the line, one on either side of the first point and wait 1/2 seconds, 
  then four points in 1/4 seconds.  Keep up this process and in 2 seconds the line will be completely filled with points.<p>
    Really I would say 0=0^2=/=0.  Does zero equal one? Well who really knows, only nothing is not nothing, and not nothing is anything!
  <p>
    C++ the popular programming language is shorthand for C=C+1, there is no solution for C algebraically, but computationally it just counts up by ones!
  <p>
    "A contradiction is and isn't a contradiction!" is and isn't a contradiction.  
    If nothing contradicts about algebra, then nothing is and isn't nothing (as that's a contradiction of nothing),
     and if something contradicts then the same: nothing isn't nothing. 
      Of course nothing can be nothing too or else it wouldn't be much of a contradiction would it?<br>
      "Not a contradiction is not a contradiction!" is not a contradiction.<br>
      "A contradiction is a contradiction!" is and isn't a contradiction.<br>
      "A contradiction isn't a contradiction!" Is and isn't a contradiction.<br>
      "Not a contradiction is a contradiction!" Oh wait, no it's not! Or perhapt it isn't?  Maybe it'sn't?<br>
      So nothing contradicting is no contradiction.  And that's something, but not a contradiction. 
      Say maybe it's 1? Or i? or 2? or root 2? Or the golden ratio.  Or 3?<br>
      "'The truth is "the truth and God"' and 'God is the truth'"  is the Divine Word of John 1:1.  
      As it is:<p>
      1.The truth is.<br>
      <i>In the beginning was The Word.</i>
<br>
       2. The truth is with God. <br>
<i>And The Word was with God.</i>
       <br>
       3. God is the true.<br>
       <i>And God was the Word.</i>
<p>'The Truth is Truth is with the God who is The Truth!'<br>
  Jesus is Jesus with Iaue (who is Jesus!)<br>
  The Truth is the Truth with Jesus, the Truth!<br>
  "{A = A + [B} = A]"<br>
  The solution here is 0, so {0=0+[0}=0].  
  Or there is none of 2*0 is nothing. Or perhaps 0=2*0 and 0=0.  Kind of like saying 0=2*0=...=1, but wait don't forget nothing is nothing.
  <br> so if there is no nothing, then where did one come from since there isn't any nothing to make it!
   Nothing is not nothing so anything is nothing except for nothing, that is not nothing and that's anything and that's nothing!<br>
   So nothing is everything except nothing is nothing so everything is nothing and there is no nothing, so there is no everything.
<br> And 0*oo=x.  And x should balance your equation.  So if 8+0*oo=9, 0*oo=x=1.  
So nothing is right with the original equation, where as if you had 8+0*oo=8, nothing would be wrong with it as it's already right and could be ruined by a nothing growing too large.
<br>The idea here is to fix the broken, and preserve the righteous, hence "nothing wrong" and "nothing right", as "not wrong" and "too right".
Notice none is good but God, and creation is "very good".<br>
I feel an interesting idea is a logical language with 3 truth values: true, false, and hush, where hush(inspired by Hosea) is if it is a contradiction both true and false.
If it is hush we don't infer true = false or false = true, instead we hush it.  So no ex falso, explosion principle! Just true false and hushed (which is if it is true and false, but then we call it neither!).
So 7+0=8 is hushed because 0=x=1 and 7=/=8.  So 7=8 is false.  8=8 is true, and 7=8+0 is hush.
  </p>
  Generally speaking I don't believe in believing in evil.  So if the case can be made manny is God, and the case can be made manny is the antichrist.  I choose to believe in the Good God, not in the evil devil.

  God is God with Us, who is God.<br>
    This makes sense because God is Jesus, Jesus is Immanuel, Immanuel is God with Us.<br>
    Hence John 1:1 claiming the divinity of The Followers, His Church, could be said "God is Manny who is God."  This makes sense as God's Body is the Church.  When two or more are gathered in my name, there He Is.  It kind of works a little wonky because the "Us" is packed in with God, so it doesn't say we are God, only if you unpack it and reassociate!
<p>What do you do if salt has lost it's savor? Well it needs to be "savior", so put the Jesus back in it. Salt is a cubic lattice, and that's full of crosses.

a=2*a=4*a=16*a...a^2=2=0=c=1*2=2^a=2^(a/12)=1^1  This is all true of nothing being anything within an infinitely complex scenario. is the conundrom manny solves. So if 0 = 2 * 0, then manny solves to nothing everything and everything in between.  Manny the being that doesn't exist as he's nothing but does because he's something, but he would also not be that thing.
What if hunam life is out there all over the universe?  Have we met aliens before?  Will the universes collide?  Their saying high.  We're part of a jurisdiction.  What if the a(o|)ie(u|n} were real?  God's big plan.  This is all terribly hypothetical.  But eternal life through time.  Nothings and somethings building the manny code as a logic theory entity.  Man is a theme.  He has variation heads (or one head?) and same body (like in scifis).  Somewhere manny's live in perfect peace and harmony.  An infinite number of them, as him.  And these nothings compile new scenarios as they become c.  And  Manny is the 1 singularity.  and the 2.  It's all in 0=2*0=0^2=2^(0).  And according to parity(the study of does 0=1 by division of 2^-2 (*i????) implies a number set KNOWN AS ODIOUS, or is it 2?  Pashur 1.3247? 03(5)?) and the bible(chapter?,verse?), nothing is good.  But god is nothing says the foolishness of god which is wiser than wisdom of men, but he fought it for us. But we would not be fools, because we are wise to our foolishnes, and foolish to our wisdom.  Is the bible a good book?  theres no 1 number code for the whole bible, but supposably we have one that is perfect.  I believe the book of Bible as I am english and have many translations.  I believe Jesus is to lead our lives with us.  He's like the screen itself or something, the body as it's i but it's distorted? like the hands?  It's straight on.  Why not?  Jesus and his number, the fibonacci word?!  Are aliens around earth? On earth?  I don't know what I am.  I was a boy.  Now?  A man boy becomes an elder man?  God's here.  And I fought off the mark.  It's not real, like dragons, and dragons breath fire not water.  What about ice dragons? that's what it is(because it's in space, but on earth it spews water from it's mouth like it's luke warm, a displeased betrayer.), but it's the original sin.  it's false + false. false = false*false, not false.  We could go through the hotkeys and set them all to true, there would be negative modes.  I guess that's what's done in the games menu with the ? and ?! off on.  There was light in the beginning.  He let it be.  Or really, God had never created other universes with human life, but why? Vastness.  Was void.  Expanse, jesus on the cross.  How can I a wicked prophet be worthy?  The rider on the white horse.  Is he one?  Conquer.  What you want?  Or submission, what he wants?  How about what we want?  Want?  are we still at that?  What about Need?  what not?  I need more good family.  I have a lot.  I'm sorry if I never meet you.  In dimension x.?  The original creator.  They are so insightful the christian scriptures.!!  The vastness of gods plan is incomprehensible, evolution on a supermassive scale.  Evolution?  Digivolution!  But what am I?  God's plan, the light emc^2=pressure*volume*moles*"avogadros guacamole"*temperature*i.  THE LIGHT's energy is the lights energy emc^2pvnrt*I.  Perhaps I is all angles 1/1=i.  Perhaps it's 4. 6? 7. 9? It's fun to sing.Needs a low tone.  God created the universe,  God makes life in places.  Did all earths species come from this earth?  How general and how specific?  God does.  There's probably a void dimension.  If 0 everything.  But then what? 1.  Okay so God is 1, but 1 is evil 2? or 0 and 1 as a resolution to that pro(ba)blem and it points to everything.  God is hole entire and holy.  Is he entire?  Manny's ship is gone!  What if Jesus quest is to find manny, the manny, and bring him back.  Only he did just that through me.  He needs the father.  Some sort of energy being.  But does he?  How else would we know it were jesus?  Where's jesus?  He's really somewhere.  The light, gravity more, it's all manny, only it's an abstracted theory.  How could there be a manny in space, he's 2d(ish) with infinite complexity in integer increments.  How would God be real?  What is free will?  Like the cumulative benefit of wisdom in decision.  But this all leads to pride..Pride in the Lords ways.  The gospel of jesus christ of nazareth emanuel, virgin born King of the Jews, Anointed and Holy.  Yahjweh,  Yeshua.  Yajshuah. Yajua! Jesus.  Yajjua is an octave, and Jesus is an increment in Yawehish.
