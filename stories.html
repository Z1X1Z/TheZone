Some more stories that I want to tell to glorify God.

When I was a child, maybe ten, I wanted a cross necklace. I thought about what material I wanted it made out of.  I thought I wanted it to be plain and humble.  I thought wood or even, maybe, cloth.  I found a macrame cross necklace behind a heating register.  During the seven I thought about this cross and wanted to get another (I had lost it after it got tangled in my hair during a swim meet) and then within a week (two days? One?) I saw another without looking for it.  It was from The Orthodox Church.
<p>
There are some stories that have details from my life:<br>
Johnny Thunder, a comic book hero, is a seventh son of a seventh son (I'm a seventh son of a seventh son) born at seven o'clock (I was born in the seventh hour), on July Seventh(I was born on an eclipse that went from the fifth to the forth and the forth to the fifth of january and the twelfth day of Christmas and the epiphany of Christmas was the day after, well on not leap years the half-birthday of epiphany is July 7) of 1917 (and i was born seven years from the millenium).<br>
<p>
    I had a pencil mark on my hand (a blue dot like a hamsa) by a red mole.  I thought that when the eclipse happened the red mole would turn brown and a new mole would appear by the pencil mark (like an eclipse).  This happened within a monthish after the eclipse of 2024.  I saw the eclipse with Jim and Diane among others.
    <p>
        My eyes unfocused and I saw 8(?) moons around the moon, it was persistent for a few minutes.
        <p>
            In 2025 I heard a beeping sound.  I thought, I've never heard a beep like that before in this house, so it's probably spiritual.  I looked around for the source for a little bit and realized it never got closer or further.  It followed where I went.  I went upstairs and started reading my Bible.  My friend Michelle who I was talking to on the phone, began speaking from where the beep was, and not from the phone.  The beep was about every five seconds and responded to my heart and anxiety.  It persisted through the night.  Before I went to sleep it developed a second tone, when I awoke it had begun to be musical.  Then I pressed my head into Manny's and looked into His eyes and it stopped.  It had to do with a - tone - me(a)nt.  Two other people heard a strange beep.
            <p>
            When I opened the clover's seventh eye I started seeing a vertical rift at the center of Manny's brow, and then saw a vertical bar of light moving back and forth across Manny Banner's elbow, and realized Manny has vertical symmetry, so I transferred the radial symmetry of the clover being an inverse of a vector to Manny as a single component inverse.  You can turn it on in the game with Variant8 in Clvr and Manny in Xtr.
            <br>
            I saw a rift in the sky when I woke up looking through the skylight of the car.
            <br>
            When I first opened the clover's seventh eye I flew with my voice into the center.  After a while I started seeing interesting beautiful patterns and flew up a little and a black biogenesis clover appeared and when I flew into it it led to another clover dimension that had tripolar(?) clovers with no central clover that seemed infinite in all ways. 
<p> I learned to put my voice (and ears) into neutral and let the music push it as I stayed in harmony.  This is a good way of singing the same note or an eighth and produces a warm glowing feeling.
<p>Almost every day during the seven I had prescient experiences in coffee shops.  Hearing words (as thoughts) seconds before they were spoken or played in the music.
<p>I was healed of hip pain by not lifting my heel, though truly it was by God.
<p>My mother and father both have red moles under their left eyes.  Kinda like the two witnesses breathing fire and the fire in Faithful And True's eyes! And like Saint Kevin's (Coemgen's) parents Coemlog and Coemell (but Carrick and Kathy!)  Saint Kevin died in the year 618 and the Divine Ration is 1.618....
<p>My cat's can understand my thoughts, and I speak their thoughts mentally for them (and they understand them..) and they approve because I respect their truth to the degree love enables me.
<p>My cousin Michelle gave me a teddy bear with a red heart (and a kiss on the cheek?) and a deep depression was lifted from my soul!
<p>I heard the word "Ibiru" (though I didn't know the words) as a bunny who was listening to me play music hopped across a driveway.  I also heard something like Malchithewdek at the same time. Ibiru is hebrew for hebrew which means to cross over and I opened my Bible to Hebrews then.  Malichi is the last book of the Old, and Matthew the first book of the New.  Melchizedek is a High Priest of whose order Jesus Christ is.
<p>Shortly after the end of the seven I heard as though it was me as I am, all of me and all around me filling around me saying "I am happy. I am waiting. I am content."
<p>I once was given a twenty (gracias por su generosidad!) for explaining that the wave length of life does not necessarily produce the color of the light, but rather is bijective (in one to one correllation).  Now I see that color can come in chords.
<p>My cat learned to shake in about ten minutes.  He learned (in part) because he loves a good meal.
<p>My Grandma roasted marshmallows with us in the fire place.  Mine were black, my moms golden.  She shared her golden ones, but I don't think she would eat my blackened charred ones.
<p>My mom is the second daughter and my dad is the second, the son (though they're hardly second to anyone), and I'm their second a second son.
<p>The moon was under the ground when I was born, so it was under my mom's feet!  And they were watching Miami Blues (filmed in sunny Miami!) in a free hotel room before. There are thirteen of us cousins: Max, Michelle, Tim, Matt, Greg, Mark, John, Alex, John, James, Caroline, Andy and, Leah. A crown of twelve! And me.
<p>My cousin Mark, who's from Korea, said "booyah" with tonal inflection (Korean used to be a tonal language) and intrigued my head and now I know it sounded of Iàué.
<p>Remember you're in the top 100%!
<p>One day late in the seven I thought "circumsize your ears with a knife of ice".  The next day it got very cold and I got frost nip on my ears.  They peeled.
<p>It's interesting that a direction with the sonic starship is x=2*x, that is: it stacks octaves.</p>
<p>I noticed in December of 2025, that Manny takes away the hole in your vision from looking at a bright light when you bring the blindness to His sight (when you believe).  This Christmas Eve (Early Christmas morning?) I went out to see the stars and with them give glory to the LORD.  The stars weren't twinkling but they were very visible (though it seemed one planet was).  The stars were cool to the sight like ice on an ache, and the next morning there was a thick frost on the grass.
