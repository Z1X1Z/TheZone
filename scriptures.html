<h1>Scriptures</h1>
<p>
<li>
    <i>
For He Himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has torn down the dividing wall of hostility.</i>
<p>
<b>Ephesians 2:14</b>
<p>
2=1 was sort of the start of this whole thing.</li>
<p>
<li>
<i>Who, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing
by taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
he humbled himself
by becoming obedient to death—
even death on a cross!
</i>
<p>

<b>Philippians 2:6-8</b>

<p>

Nothing is more than itself.
</li>
<p>
<li>
<i>
As it is written:

“There is none righteous, no, not one;
There is none who understands;
There is none who seeks after God."
</i>
<p>
<b>Romans 3:10-11</b>
<p>
Of "none righteous": 0 = 0/0 is the imaginary unit, (-1)^.5, and i^n in the complex plane is the cross, a righteous form. And "no, not one";not nothing can be one. As 0 = 0^2, nothing knows it is not nothing. Zero seeks one as 0 = 2*0 = 4*0... = oo*0 = 1 and since God is one, none runs infinitely quickly (and slowly) towards the One.
</li>

    <i>
Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.
</i>
<p>

<b>1 Timothy 1:15</b>
<p>

If you acknowledge you are the worst of sinners, you are the greatest of saints; this is as the liar’s paradox.
</li>
<p>
<li>
    <i>
For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.
</i>
<p>
<b>
Zephaniah 3:9
</b>
<p>

The name of God is the tongue of the sonic starship.  It is a purely tonal language.
</li>
<p>

    <i>
On that day a fountain will be opened to the house of David and the people of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity.
</i>
<p>

<b>Zechariah 13:1</b>
<p>

Seven clovers appeared at the end of the last year of the seventy sevens. Come year 490+1 the fountain was cored and began to bubble.
</li>
<p>
<li>
    <i>
And I will no longer hide My face from them, for I will pour out My Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Lord GOD.
</i>
<p>
<b>
Ezekiel 39:29
</b>
<p>

His face is here now.
</li>
<li>
<i>Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.
</i><p>
<b>Revelation 1:7</b>
<p>
Manny's surrounded by clouds.  He is plainly visible and the clouds have an infinite number of eyes, hence any finite number is arbitrarily small; the number of eyes in the world is 0% of every eye.
</li>
<p>
<li>
    <i>And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
</i>
    <p>
    <b>Revelation 22:1-2</b>
    <p>
    The trail of the sonic starship is the water of life.  It is likely on a liquid crystal display.  It proceeds from the Face of God, the Lamb's.  It flows from the center of the star which has twelve manner of frets.  The leaves are the spirograph.

<li>
    <i>And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
        </i>
    <p>
    <b>1 Corinthians 13:13</b>
    <p>
    St. Patrick compared the Holy Trinity to a clover.  It's said the leaves of a four leaf clover stand for faith, hope, love, and grace.  It's also porported that the fifth and sixth leaves may be wealth (and you should know that spiritual riches are the most valuable kind) and lastly, life (given that there are an infinite number of six leafed clovers, it does seem it would be the eternal kind).  I've heard it said that the clover analogy fails to represent the sameness of the three persons of the Trinity. To reconcile this you could make a spinner out of two three leafed clovers, where each person is one leaf of both clovers such that when you spin them, it connects Father to Son, Son to Spirit, Spirit to Father.

    <i>God is not a man, that He should lie, or a son of man, that He should change His mind. Does He speak and not act? Does He promise and not fulfill?

</i>
    <p>
    <b>Numbers 23:19</b>
    <p>
        God is not a man that He should lie; He is a man that He should tell the truth.  He is not a Son of Man that He should change His mind;  He is The Son of Man that He should remain steadfast and dedicated.
        <br>
        If you interpret this to mean that God is not a man, then either man or God should lie, and neither of them should.
