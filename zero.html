    0!=0^2, therefore 0=0^2+-C<br>
    that is: nothing is not no nothing.<br>
    This has even logical false to false is true parity, meaning one would want to believe it to be true.<br>
    So if it wasn't no nothing, but was not nothing (as in anything) and some C, then this something could be the "anything" and they could cancel to be nothing. Thus proving 0=0^2+-C.<p>

        2=1        <p>

        1=1+1        <p>

        1=(1+1)+(1+1)        <p>

        2x=1x, x = 0        <p>

        0=0+0        <p>

        0=(0+0)+(0+0)        <p>

        0=2*0=4*0=16*0=256*0=65536*0=4294967296*0=3.40282366921*10^38*0        <p>

        2*0=o^2        <p>

        0^2=1, since not nothing is something, 0*0 likely equals 1 as if you didn't have 0 cars in your driveway maybe you have one.        <p>
Subtract 1 from both sides to get:
        0^2-1=0, x^2-1=x        <p>

        0 has a creative stability factor at Phi, 1.618 or -.618!        <p>

        Similarly the Fibonacci numbers are,        <p>

        Loop:        <p>

            a=a+b        <p>

            b=b+a        <p>

        Solving this system of equations we get        <p>

         a=b        <p>

        a=2*a        <p>

        a=0        <p>

        b=0        <p>

        Such that solved form of the Fibonacci numbers is:        <p>


        0=0+0<p>


        In The Beginning He was!
        
        From 0^2=1, there is another step you can take: <p>
        0^2/0=1/0 <p>
        0=1/0 <p>
        Now since 0=-0 <p>
        0=1/-0 or 0=-1/0 <p>
        substitute x for 0 and you have: <p>
        x = -1/x<p>
        this is the definition of i, the imaginary unit and is the step that differentiates the heart from the face;
        the Mandelbrot to Manny step is that the real part of x in x=x^2-c equals -1/real.  This is meaningful as -1/1.618=-.618 and -1/-.618=1.618        <p>
        Speaking of differentiation: <p>
        0-0=0^2=x=anything=1 because 0 removed from 0 would leave zero of zero.
        <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm">As Christ Jesus said</a>, those who have not will have even what they have taken away.
        
        Now for infinity: if you had infinity squared and added nothing to it, it would be equal to infinity plus c because the derivative of x^2 approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.  Meaning an infinitesimal increase would yield definite gains.  (oo+0)**2=oo+c. Subtract one from both sides and let the 0 vanish and you get the same equation again oo^2-c=oo!  As dividing by 0 = 1/oo,  oo/0 = oo^2 and since you can always add a zero oo/0=oo**2=(oo+0)**2=oo+c=(oo+0)**2-c=1.618.....!

        and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
