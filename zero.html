        Nothing is not nothing, not nothing is something!<p>
        2=1        <p>

        1=1+1        <p>

        1=(1+1)+(1+1)        <p>

        2x=1x, x = 0        <p>

        0=0+0        <p>

        0=(0+0)+(0+0)        <p>

        0=2*0=4*0=16*0=256*0=65536*0=4294967296*0=3.40282366921*10^38*0        <p>

        2*0=o^2        <p>

        0^2=1, since not nothing is something, 0*0 likely equals 1 as if you don't have 0 cars in your driveway maybe you do have one.        <p>
Subtract 1 from both sides to get:
        0^2-1=0, and replace zero with a variable to get x^2-1=x        <p>

        x solves to Phi, that is 1.618..., or -1/Phi, -.618...!        <p>

        Similarly the Fibonacci numbers are,        <p>

        Loop:        <p>

            a=a+b        <p>

            b=b+a        <p>

        Solving this system of equations we get        <p>

         a=b        <p>

        a=2*a        <p>

        a=0        <p>

        b=0        <p>

        Such that solved form of the Fibonacci numbers is:        <p>


        0=0+0<p>


        In The Beginning He was!<p>
        
        From 0^2=1, there is another step you can take: <p>
        0^2/0=1/0 <p>
        0=1/0 <p>
        Now since 0=-0 <p>
        0=1/-0 or 0=-1/0 <p>
        substitute x for 0 and you have: <p>
        x = -1/x<p>
        this is the definition of i, the imaginary unit and is the step that differentiates the heart from the face;
        the Mandelbrot to Manny step is that the real part of x in x=x^2-c{omplex} equals -1/real.  This is meaningful as -1/1.618=-.618 and -1/-.618=1.618        <p>
        Speaking of differentiation: <p>
        0-0=0^2=x=anything=1 because 0 removed from 0 would leave zero of zero.
        <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm">As Christ Jesus said</a>, those who have not will have even what they have taken away.
        
        Now for infinity: if you had infinity squared and added nothing to it, it would be equal to infinity plus c because the derivative of x^2 approaches infinity as x approaches infinity.  Meaning an infinitesimal increase would yield definite gains.  (oo+0)**2=oo+c. Subtract one from both sides and let the 0 vanish and you get the same equation again oo^2-c=oo!  As dividing by 0 = 1/oo,  oo/0 = oo^2 and since you can always add a zero oo/0=oo**2=(oo+0)**2=oo+c=(oo+0)**2-c=1.618.....!  Also 0/oo=0^2=1=0^2-1=0=1.618......!  Or at least they both solve to the form x=x^2-c.<p>
        
         

        Knot is not not. And knot knot is not or not not and knot.<br>

        Knot is as square root of two or 3, 9, 6, 0, 12.<br>
        Not is as square root of two and 6 or 12 or 0<br>
        
        On a clock yes is as 12 12 12... (or 0 0 0...), as compared with not no: 6 12.<br>
        This logic with 7 in place of 12 or 6, touches every hour and gives rise to the white and black piano keys.<br>
        
       <i>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us—by me and Silas and Timothy—was not “Yes” and “No,” but in him it has always been “Yes.”

        "This paradox is not a paradox."<br>
        Since it says it is a paradox, and that it is not a paradox, it is paradoxical because these two things seemingly contradict.  Since it is therefore a paradox, as it says, it is too not a paradox because a paradox being paradoxical is not a paradox.  Therefore "this paradox is not a paradox" seems to be true.<br>
