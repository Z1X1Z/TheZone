<h1>A Sharp Two-Edged Sword of meaning(s)</h1>
When I found the body I was working on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm">this scripture.</a> The equation I had begun calculating had a two in the wrong place for the calculation but right intuitively, I kept that two and added a square root from a thought of what I hadn't tried yet.  The origin of the two suggests it could either be the number of the beast or <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm">144. 000 000 000...</a> the number of those with the seal of God.  This is as sin(666) is the negative of -cos(144).
<p>You see there are many conflicting modes of interpretation!:
<p>
The muscles of Manny have a tongue with two parts.  It could be interpreted as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-11.htm">"[speaking] like a dragon"</a>, or as a
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm">cloven tongue of fire of The Holy Spirit.</a>
<p>
The face has seven eye holies.  Eyes are as I's are as heads.  The dragon has seven heads. I think this breaks down the illusion of parallels as I don't think these are valid sequiturs.  This carries over to the flag, which has 7 red stripes like heads of the dragon, and 10 diagonals of horns.  Then again the red stripes could represent the horns and\or eyes of the Lamb,and the 50 stars would justly interpret as 7*7+1, the Lamb's jubilee.
<p>
On a new note: Teloman sounds a lot like Jesus’ words from the cross in <a "href=https://biblehub.com/text/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>, “It is finished” or “it is tetelestai”.  I take this as an ultimate truth.  Go Telomanny!!!  May good triumph over evil, and never be sullied by the battle.  For three days later….He rises again!  To Eternal Life! And Life Eternal!  May the Lord Jesus be blessed!  Forgive that ye also might be forgiven.

About TeloMan (who I invented before I ever saw Manny in dream or vision or solid reality), he's Manny's twin, THEIR BOTH GOOD.  He has a cross of two arms and two legs formed of antennas joined by a collapsible spherical (or cylindrical) gas processing and refinement central node(able to refine any gas even from nothing) to feed his balloon head and join together his antennas.  What did he have for hands? Probably antennas too? Maybe he doesn't need any, or just like a cube! He was like a kind of facilitator angel.  He can expand any where. And Manny can stretch many ways and already has a joint at the elbow and fingers on a hand with a thumb to articulate and this all just seems to fold right on up.  So. TeloMan was a literary figure and would cameo in many movies.  A just idea, a sort of heroes helper, a man who could travel through nothingness yet continue to be able to move through somethingness with a balloon for a head.  He had a flying boat and liked spoons and cups (that's what I was practicing drawing around that time) Sometimes teloMan can get superbig by decollapsing thicker segments of antenna, though often he would be small like arm length of 1-2(3?) feet and limb diameter of half an inch or so thick at the base.  He could also be infinitely long and thin but then he would be in danger of cutting the universe into pieces.  Teloman once appeared, seemingly from nowhere, in front of a green car peeling it's tires down an alleyway.  He quickly floated up over the car which rushed by. THE END. Or The Beginning?<br>
Thing is a balloon has many properties in common with an inverse square like Manny (a negative inverse square plus c). Given we have 1/((radius+c)^2)=balloon thickness, we could use a 1/ hoverboard to get rid of the 1/ and derive ((x+c)^2+c)^2=x. Then we get x=1/((x+c)^2+c)^2, this is the same process as Manny, just missing a negative (and a positive is a negative negative) at the beginning, and with an extra square.  Manny is essentially a balloons surface density found using an inverse square.  Given it's a stretch, but they both can!  Then there are the bodies of TeloMan and Manny.  Manny can fold up triangles style (with an elbow joint to start) allowing him to collapse into a point.  And TeloMan is made of antennas capable of collapsing to a point and a balloon which can completely deflate and once it's empty it disappears (right?).  Manny is root two and a square around a 1X1X1X1 cross (like teloman with his arms and legs in an x) has along the side lengths of root two.  Manny's also 1.  Boy do these brothers have a lot in common.  And they Both Love to The Point of Being Jesus and His Good Father God.  With this much love, the Devil can't ruin our day.<p>
If you took a step and in half as much time you took a second full sized step and in half that much time stepped again and so on you would reach infinity in as long as it takes to take two slow steps.<p>
TeloMan and Manny are two (and infinite) steps and together they carry creation to Jesus' right hand forever and ever where evil can't go. One will be taken and one will be left.  And then one half is taken and one half is left. Then one quarter and so on. Until nothing is left and all is in the kingdom of heaven.  Where two or more are gathered in His name, there He is!
