<h1>A Sharp Two-Edged Sword of meaning(s)</h1>
When I found the body I was working on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm">this scripture.</a> The equation I had begun calculating had a two in the wrong place for the calculation but right intuitively, I kept that two and added a square root from a thought of what I hadn't tried yet.  The origin of the two suggests it could either be the number of the beast or <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm">144. 000 000 000...</a> the number of those with the seal of God.  This is as sin(666) is the negative of -cos(144).
<p>You see there are many conflicting modes of interpretation!:
<p>
The muscles of Manny have a tongue with two parts.  It could be interpreted as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-11.htm">"[speaking] like a dragon"</a>, or as a
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm">cloven tongue of fire of The Holy Spirit.</a>
<p>
The face has seven eye holies.  Eyes are as I's are as heads.  The dragon has seven heads. I think this breaks down the illusion of parallels as I don't think these are valid sequiturs.  This carries over to the flag, which has 7 red stripes like heads of the dragon, and 10 diagonals of horns.  Then again the red stripes could represent the horns and\or eyes of the Lamb,and the 50 stars would justly interpret as 7*7+1, the Lamb's jubilee.
<p>
On a new note: Teloman sounds a lot like Jesus’ words from the cross in <a "href=https://biblehub.com/text/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>, “It is finished” or “it is tetelestai”.  I take this as an ultimate truth.  Go Telomanny!!!  May good triumph over evil, and never be sullied by the battle.  For three days later….He rises again!  To Eternal Life! And Life Eternal!  May the Lord Jesus be blessed!  Forgive that ye also might be forgiven.
<p>
About TeloMan (who I invented before I ever saw Manny in dream or vision or solid reality), he's Manny's twin, THEIR BOTH GOOD.  He has a cross of two arms and two legs formed of antennas joined by a collapsible spherical (or cylindrical) gas processing and refinement central node(able to refine any gas even from nothing) to feed his balloon head and join together his antennas.  What did he have for hands? Probably antennas too? Maybe he doesn't need any, or just like a cube! He was like a kind of facilitator angel.  He can expand any where. And Manny can stretch many ways and already has a joint at the elbow and fingers on a hand with a thumb to articulate and this all just seems to fold right on up.  So. TeloMan was a literary figure and would cameo in many movies.  A just idea, a sort of heroes helper, a man who could travel through nothingness yet continue to be able to move through somethingness with a balloon for a head.  He had a flying boat and liked spoons and cups (that's what I was practicing drawing around that time) Sometimes teloMan can get superbig by decollapsing thicker segments of antenna, though often he would be small like arm length of 1-2(3?) feet and limb diameter of half an inch or so thick at the base.  He could also be infinitely long and thin but then he would be in danger of cutting the universe into pieces.  Teloman once appeared, seemingly from nowhere, in front of a green car peeling it's tires down an alleyway.  He quickly floated up over the car which rushed by. THE END. Or The Beginning?<br>
Thing is a balloon has many properties in common with an inverse square like Manny (a negative inverse square plus c). Given we have 1/((radius+c)^2)=balloon thickness, we could use a 1/ hoverboard to get rid of the 1/ and derive ((x+c)^2+c)^2=x. Then we get x=1/((x+c)^2+c)^2, this is the same process as Manny, just missing a negative (and a positive is a negative negative) at the beginning, and with an extra square.  Manny is essentially a balloons surface density found using an inverse square.  Given it's a stretch, but they both can!  Then there are the bodies of TeloMan and Manny.  Manny can fold up triangles style (with an elbow joint to start) allowing him to collapse into a point.  And TeloMan is made of antennas capable of collapsing to a point and a balloon which can completely deflate and once it's empty it disappears (right?).  Manny is root two and a square around a 1X1X1X1 cross (like teloman with his arms and legs in an x) has along the side lengths of root two.  Manny's also 1.  Boy do these brothers have a lot in common.  And they Both Love to The Point of Being Jesus and His Good Father God.  With this much love, the Devil can't ruin our day.<p>
If you took a step and in half as much time you took a second full sized step and in half that much time stepped again and so on you would reach infinity in as long as it takes to take two slow steps.<p>
TeloMan and Manny are two (and infinite) steps and together they carry creation to Jesus' right hand forever and ever where evil can't go. One will be taken and one will be left.  And then one half is taken and one half is left. Then one quarter and so on. Until nothing is left and all is in the kingdom of heaven.  Where two or more are gathered in His name, there He is!
<br>
And so I say Simon Peter, on this Rock He will build His House.  And the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it! May Jesus cut loose and bring the kingdom only to those who seek it in Him!  How do we pray? In His Name.  What do we worship? His Name. Who is He? Perhaps your sister's brother?  Perhaps another?  But why, won't He do?  Some sin? Some inperfection? Let it be Jesus' Son!  Let it be his Daughter's Name.  Let them smile on their God, the One true father.  Who won our hearts with His cross crossed life.  Who lives in eternal dominion with those who accept His word into their heart.  The light is more than legion.  Pigs consumed him, sea consumed the pigs.  Light shines from Yeshua's right balance.  And he consumes the Day of Days unto the Day of Days.
<p>
    Generally speaking I don't believe in believing in evil (rather I believe in not evil).  So if the case can be made manny is God, and the case can be made manny is the antichrist.  I choose to believe in The Good One: The God, and not in the devil, because the devil is a liar and I don't want to believe in his lies.  So do I believe in evil? Do not know evil! I do believe Jesus saves.  If you believe God is the Devil then you believe in the Image of The Beast, the abomination of desolation.  I believe in the image of the god and that the devil is gone from our Father's world and our hearts if you'll believe in God and His Son with me.  
<p>
  That said, what if the lord our god is 2. But the Father killed his son so he was only 1.  And then the Father killed himself.  I ask what would Abrahaam have done holding his dead son Isaac? Plunge the knife into his heart! 2=1, 1=0, 0=1=a whole bunch of sinners saved by the salvation brought of two dead people.  Now who died next after Jesus? The father? The forgiven sinner.  Like after Stephen died, Saul died.  And Paul was born.
<br>So is Iscariot ever to be Whiskaret? If Jesus doesn't forgive Judas, his killer, then isn't Jesus a hypocrite?  Here's a word of wisdom, Jesus isn't a hypocrite.  And if he was angry with Judas, surely you can see that was just, and Judas can forgive and be forgiven.  So just accept forgiveness and give it back double.  For 0 Give 0^2. keep in mind 0 = 1 = 2.  The Lord our God is Father Jesus (that is Israel, God's only son), and his Son Judah, and the Holy Spirit! Don't forget Peter, for he is nothing in this picture, a rock in the earth, for surrounding him are the 10, not generally, namely Matthew, John, Bartholamew, Thaddeus, Judas, Nathaniel, Andrew, James, Simon, and Philip.  Don't forget the eleventh Paul, and Matthias makes twelve!  Peter, surrounded by the twelve!  And he's at the Gates at the Origin of heaven.  Right at the center, the lamb's eyes.  So how are you?  Good? Hard to believe but none is good, except god...saves!  He saves to pay for his children.  To have something to give to the poor, for though he may have disregarded them into poverty once, he hopes to make their nothing right, by taking away their poverty, and giving them a tenth of the first of all he receives.
<br> For as the lesson of the loaves of life taught, where the need is greater, the response from God is greater.  And who needs a greater response more than the worst of sinners who has lost what the lord has given him? Even his nothing will be taken away -0-0=-2*0=100.  Or would Abraham have looked up and spared his own life, giving up his God instead, like the entangled sheep who gave his life in actuality to save Isaac, and Abraham, and Jacob, and Judah (Joseph?) and his brothers and you and me?  Surely Iscariot is dead, his guts burst out, fallen headlong, surely Jesus is alive forevermore. And Peter too.  I don't believe in evil, I don't believe in the Second death, I believe none is Righteous and there is not no God. And no God is not no God, as it's the scriptural belief of the fool, as there is none good except god.  One is left and good is taken and he leaves something behing, and that is taken, yet it leaves something behind, until none is taken and what is left?  You can probably gander a guess.  Maybe it's a gander of geese! Or a swan!  Want another? No, more!  Even the worst can change.  With work the worst won't be want for wisdom!  Ick what wit won't forget! What have I forgotten?  So much, yet a little have I not forgotten.  A little baby Jesus, born of the Holy Ghost and Mary. So be merry whether ye be married or "merely" betrothed to God with Us.
<p>
  Merrily Merrily Merrily I row my boat down the stream.  Merrily Merrily Merrily life is but a dream.  Let the nightmare cease and God's will be done.  He is the Three who are One (and a Half), and 0 and infinity!  The God that is He who He is with or without something (g=g^2+-s)
