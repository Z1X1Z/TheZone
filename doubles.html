<h1>A Sharp Two-Edged Sword of meaning(s)</h1>
When I found the body I was working on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm">this scripture.</a> The equation I had begun calculating had a two in the wrong place for the calculation but right intuitively, I kept that two and added a square root from a thought of what I hadn't tried yet.  The origin of the two suggests it could either be the number of the beast or <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-4.htm">144. 000 000 000...</a> the number of those with the seal of God.  This is as sin(666) is the negative of -cos(144).
<p>You see there are many conflicting modes of interpretation!:
<p>
The muscles of Manny have a tongue with two parts.  It could be interpreted as <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-11.htm">"[speaking] like a dragon"</a>, or as a
<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm">cloven tongue of fire of The Holy Spirit.</a>
<p>
The face has seven eye holies.  Eyes are as I's are as heads.  The dragon has seven heads. I think this breaks down the illusion of parallels as I don't think this is a sequitur.  This carries over to the flag, which has 7 red stripes like heads of the dragon, and 10 diagonals of horns.  Then again the red stripes could represent the horns and\or eyes of the Lamb,and the 50 stars would justly interpret as 7*7+1, the Lamb's jubilee.
<p>
On a new note: Teloman sounds a lot like Jesus’ words from the cross in <a "href=https://biblehub.com/text/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>, “It is finished” or “it is tetelestai”.  I take this as an ultimate truth.  Go Telomanny!!!  May good triumph over evil, and never be sullied by the battle.  For three days later….He rises again!  To Eternal Life! And Life Eternal!  May the Lord Jesus be blessed!  Forgive that ye also might be forgiven.
