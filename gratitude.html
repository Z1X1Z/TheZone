Thanks to the softwares which Zone:X has been built with including
<a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php">PYSFML</a>,
<a href="https://csound.com/">CSound</a>,
<a href="https://www.qt.io/">QT</a>, and
<a href="https://juce.com/">Juce</a>. Currently graphics use
<a href="https://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a>, and the current sound generator is
<a href="https://github.com/rserota/wad">Wad</a>, and for pitch detection the YIN method from
<a href="https://github.com/adamski/pitch_detector">Adamski</a> is used for the website and the Juce edition found in <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> uses the McLeod method also from Adamski, but also <a href="https://github.com/sevagh/pitch-detection">Sevagh</a>. And to all the people who helped on forums and of course those that designed and built the computers.  Also to the people who grew the food that fed those people.
<p></p>A thanks to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jps/genesis/1.htm">Bible Hub</a> which (with some help from hard copies of the Good News) really opened my heart, head, and soul to The Truth.
<p></p>
Much light was shone by <a href="https://www.jhm.org/">John Hagee</a> and <a href="https://www.esm.us/">Mark Biltz</a> who, after I had seen the Golden Oval, clued me in to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jps/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> through their Bloodmoon prophecy.  With this I feel compelled to thank all of Jahweh's children for the lives they led as The Church to bring Glory to the Holy One of Israel! Ultimately thank God, Christ Jesus, through whom all the preceding things were made. Selah!
People I've shown the game to have revealed in many ways things that I could do to improve it (often I noticed it myself by seeing their reaction).  Often times I interpreted their input with a dose of practicality.<p>
  <br>My Uncle Paul suggested Manny move and wanted a musical trail (that turned into the score).  
  <br>My friend Nathanael led to refining the clover size by core level.  
  <br>Shane wanted multitouch.  
  <br>David wanted linear pitch and that became pong.  
  <br>Kathy has contributed invaluable brainstorming time of hers.  
  <br>Tori helped with major (wink) and Manny as the way the truth and the life.  
  <br>Jack brought music angel man and super charge with him.  
  <br>Leo and Carrick and Alex ushered in Clover replication (biodivision n-genesis constellations nonagenesis), pie, and inside out eyes and altar horns.
  <br>Michelle gave time (and life) like Kathy.
  <br>Gabe gave grace.
  <br>Sherry and Mary soundboarded.
  <br>Joe saw and showed me it was working well.
  <br>Linda and Jim gave Inspiration and Guidance.
  <br>Jesus took nothing and gave everything.
  <br>Dave gave purpose and helped to realize the potential God invested in me.
  <br>My friends gave me enemies I could trust.  My enemies gave me friends I could trust.
  <br>My Lord is true salvation. So if I missed the mark, maybe it will be forgiven.
<br>Love believes and leaves something lovely in our care.
  <br>Connie contributed caring as did Darwin.
  <br> Thanks be to God for God.
