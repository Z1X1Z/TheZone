Thanks to the softwares which Zone:X has been built with including
<a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php">PYSFML</a>,
<a href="https://csound.com/">CSound</a>,
<a href="https://www.qt.io/">QT</a>, and
<a href="https://juce.com/">Juce</a>. Currently graphics use
<a href="https://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a>, and the current sound generator is
<a href="https://github.com/rserota/wad">Wad</a>, and for pitch detection the YIN method from
<a href="https://github.com/adamski/pitch_detector">Adamski</a> is used for the website and the Juce edition found in <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a> uses the McLeod method also from Adamski, but also <a href="https://github.com/sevagh/pitch-detection">Sevagh</a>. And to all the people who helped on forums and of course those that designed and built the computers.  Also to the people who grew the food that fed those people.
<p></p>A thanks to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jps/genesis/1.htm">Bible Hub</a> which (with some help from hard copies of the Good News) really opened my heart, head, and soul to The Truth.
<p></p>
Much light was shone by <a href="https://www.jhm.org/">John Hagee</a> and <a href="https://www.esm.us/">Mark Blitz</a> who, after I had seen the Golden Oval, clued me in to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jps/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a> through their Bloodmoon prophecy.  With this I feel compelled to thank all of Jahweh's children for the lives they led as The Church to bring Glory to the Holy One of Israel! Ultimately thank God, Christ Jesus, through whom all the preceding things were made. Selah!
