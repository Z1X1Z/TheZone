<body>    
    Born Kevin Harold Legrismith in Herrick Hospital,<br>
     Borne to Kodesh Hakodashim (holy of holies), by Carrick, half-asleep,<br>
     Bored of Kwizatz Haderak like the Kereikion's haywire,<br>
     bought by the eternal Kohen Gadol's sacrificial crucifixion,<br>
     dubbed Kevin from Heaven by Kathleen the Valet,<br>
     Seventh son in a row of Glendalough,<br>
     Seventh son in a row of Clinton's Book Club,<br>
     Seventh son in a row of cousins,<br>
     sent like Bard's black arrow to smite Smaug to the seventh,<br>
     See it's like how I spontaneously saw, bullseyed, the bull's eye.<br>
     the edge of the 47th of 49 occultations, of Aldebaran at 4:44 AM<br>
     Speaking of the eye of taurus': turns out the eye on the tower, (not Sauron's, not the Illuminati's)<br>
     is the Way the Truth the Light,<br>
     The Alpha the Omega.<br>
     The lullaby says make two three and you’ve got the whole world to feed.<br>
     Always wandering about wondering about the one ring,<br>
     warring with the dark lord within, the shard of Voldemort in my soul,<br>
     jarring to find the anagram in my name as in Tom Marvolo’s,<br>
     Okay it's a torn riddle, broken open and thrown away just so it's gone like a Marbolo,<br>
     good riddance, who cares about a cig nullified? Signal if I lied.<br>
     Okay so I'm short an O but since ought's nought, naughty I'd not. A’ight? Oughtn’t I also say:<br>
     I'm Harry Potter, because I'm named Harry, and my Father's the Potter.<br>
     Though I'm missing Ginny, I'm no misogynist...<br>
     I’m Lupes son, perchance not a lobeison, perfectly reformed in universal righteousness.<br>
    
    Nigh Noah’s Hebrew day of Ararat: 7-17-5775,<br>
    In the lunar Jubilee of the rejuvenation of Jerusalem to the Jewish nation,
    Israel,<br>
     I returned to what is real,<br>
     first, some days after claiming the sun was the moon,<br>
     I saw four stars appear around a crown of eight daisies,<br>
     star flowers as translated from the latin name in Linneus' nomenclature,<br> then<br> "Golden oval" I heard with a pop in my ear.<br>
     As in the Tree of Good and Evil, from the<br>
     Garden of Eden, where in<br>
     God, Adam, Eve, were, until that<br>
     Goat, the Devil<br>
     Goaded the double<br>
     of them to make that fatal error.<br>
    
    Yet though once, she said she couldn’t even touch it.<br>
    
    Yet now it clothes her, to God’s Glory.<br>
    
    Glory To God!<br>
    
     So I became, perhaps, the Seventh Son of the Seventh Son, the son of David, by his Son Jesus,<br>
     Protegee turned prodegy returned as a prodigal.<br>
     Excuse this poetry, just trying to spare you the prosody,
    now I'm more a Zionist than a scientist so without dilemma this lemma I'll admit:<br>
     JESUS IS LORD OVER ALL!!
