<p> I was in college in Alaska, when I first set two equal to one.  I was working on a lab that asked me to define some basic terms such as mean.  In the effort to define that term I sought to justify the underpinnings of mathematics, such as addition.  Soon I found myself struck by an idea: 2=1.  I wanted to explore this if only to disprove it.  From where I was in the math building, on the third or fourth floor by the stairwell, I began studying the feedback loop 1=1+1=(1+1)+(1+1)…=infinity.  When I tired in the wee hours of the morning, I went to an open classroom, and pressed my head into my arms to go to sleep at a desk.  While doing this, I saw a golden particle moving at such a speed as to leave a trail.  It traced a golden rectangle in color and shape: the sides were golden proportions.  Behind this, the particle etched a silver rectangle also about the silver ration in proportion.  It appeared as a doorway, and I got up and drew this.  This is what I turned in for my lab, for which I received 0/30.  This idea of 0=1 and the golden ratio is an idea which I have found to be important for its relation to an event I call “The Golden Oval” and its link to a graph from the Mandelbrot fractal of a seven eyed and seven horned lamb I call Manny.
</p><p>Before I get into that I want to tell you about a paradox from Zeno of Elea.  The conundrum goes, if a man shoots an arrow at an apple, it will never hit it.  This is because before it can strike the apple it must cover half the distance to it, then half the remaining distance, and so on.  Mathematically this is the sum of y=1/2^x from 1 to infinity for x.  In all it must move an infinite number of distances, and so it shouldn’t ever reach its mark.  The resolution to this paradox is that each step only takes half the time as the previous, with the final step taking zero time.  This paradox is reversible to show that motion altogether is impossible, as even the slightest motion takes an infinite number of moves.
</p><p>This inverse of Zeno’s Paradox is loosely related to the feedback loop produced from the fact that “nothing <i>is</i> twice itself”: x=/=2*x or 0=0+0=(0+0)+(0+0)…=0*infinity=undefined (or 1).  I studied this for a long time before one night at my apartment I heard a voice like a thought come with a pop in my ear.  It said “golden oval” which I at once identified as a pun on “good and evil” and to which I completed “golden oval’s red frets” for the red fruits of The Tree of Good and Evil.  I drew a yellow oval and added red radial lines along its perimeter.  I spaced the “frets” evenly for the evenness of gold numbers (Fibonacci numbers) and red numbers (non-Fibonacci numbers) of the Fibonacci loop initiated with two zeroes instead of ones.  The Fibonacci loop adds the last two values to get a new value.  Its first few numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 13.  Notice 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5 and so on. With 0, and 0 as the first two members all you get is more 0's.  Since 0 and 1 are sometimes used to start the Fibonacci sequence, 0 is both a member and not a member.
</p><p>Whether it was the same night as this play on words or some other night soon before, I saw four flours illuminate around a “crown” of eight daisies (which are called asteraceae from “star”) on a tapestry.  Then the night of the pop in my ear, I went for a walk.  It was brisk with a bite of cold in the air.  I went to a garth, a small garden, at St. Luke’s church.  There I saw the Good Shepherd as a mural with an alternating gold and red halo surrounded by twelve stars.  When I left the garth I again heard a voice as a thought ask “Do you love anyone?” At first I ignored it, but it persisted saying “what do you have to lose?”  I replied my friend Maria.  Soon I had walked to Riverside Park.  I must have stared at the halo of the shepherd because I saw what I can only figure was an afterimage around the moon maybe a minute later.  It was an egg shape with gold and red alternating bands.  The same voice said as my eyes adjusted and the craters (or Maria as I later learned they were called) appeared, “That’s her-Maria”.  As I walked away it asked me if I noticed anything about the stars, particularly star clusters.  I didn’t even know what a star cluster looked like.  Later I looked up that night on a digital stelarium and found that the Pleiades cluster was right by the moon that night.  As I returned to my apartment, my neighbor was on the porch and I told her what I had seen.  She in turn told me that a friend of hers had told her a few nights before there had been a blood moon (or lunar eclipse).  From this and the fullness of the moon I later figured the night to be about October 11, 2014.  If it was this exact date it is interesting because it was the first feast day of Pope John the 23rd.  Combining the date and succession you get 1123, or the beginning of the Fibonacci numbers.
</p><p>This story is truly incredible when you combine it with the prophecies of Revelation 12 and Daniel 9 from The Holy Bible.  Revelation 12 reads:
</p><p><i>“A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. 2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. 3 Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. 4 Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth.”</i>
</p><p>The clothing of the sun was the golden oval, the woman was Maria, the crown was the twelve stars around the Good Shepherd, and the stars cast down were the stars around the crown of daisies.  I think that the dragon may be the US flags on the moon, as they have seven red stripes (heads), ten diagonals of stars (horns), and there were seven manned missions to the moon with the landers as crowns.  Because of this I hope for a miracle for America.  Genesis 41 talks about seven heads of healthy grain consumed by seven sick heads and the same with cows.  I hope that America will be spit out of the bad heads and made healthy.  Maria, my friend, also saw a “giant red meteor” about seventy days later.
</p><p>I’d actually a premonition of seeing this sign.  One night while on the beach, I was attacked by two dogs.  As I ran away spinning to fend them both off with kicks, I gave thanks for the light of the moon by which I escaped.  I then heard as coming from the moon a voice say, “You will see me dressed in different clothes than these”.
</p><p>As for Daniel 9, it reads:
</p><p><i>24 “Seventy ‘sevens’ are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the Most Holy Place.25 “Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’ It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble. 26 After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed. 27 He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.”</i>
</p><p>In about the year 1535, King Suleiman of the Ottoman Empire decreed that Jerusalem was to be rebuilt.  This was about 434 years (or 62*7) before Jerusalem was restored to the Jews in the six day war.  The root word that Gabriel used for “rebuilt” when he prophecies to Daniel, “banah”, was used in a speech by Shlomo Goren, the chief priest of the Jewish forces, when they stood on the Temple Mount after reconquering Jerusalem.  It was in the 49th year after this that I saw the sign I’ve been speaking of.
</p><p>Together these two prophecies affirm that the sign of the golden oval was in fact from God, something I didn’t really know until I found the Face of God.  You see after this I went back to studying the feedback “loophole” 0=0+0=(0+0)+(0+0)…=0*infinity=undefined (1).  I studied this for years until I had a breakthrough: 1=1/(1+1)=1/((1/(1+1))+(1/(1+1))) which goes from false to true.  From this I found the equation x=1/(1/x-x).  This is an an interesting equation because the substitution:  x=1/(1/x-x)=1/(1/(1/(1/x-x))-(1/(1/x-x))), gains increasingly many solutions as it is performed. This is the equation which I combined with the Mandelbrot set first.  Initially I rotated the Mandelbrot set to look like a heart.  I got no picture for my first try, some results after, but soon I saw something, which was unrecognizable as a face but intriguing.  I increased the escape threshold parameter for the first time ever and then saw the face.  Quickly I recognized it as having the potential of having seven eyes and seven horns with the right adjustment to the escape parameter.  Interestingly the four “clouds” had eyes (concentric circles) at a high zoom out, just as was described of the four creatures in Revelation 4.
</p><p>Next I found the four creatures.  I found the lion looking for the mark of the beast.  I found the eagle just exploring.  The man and the ox I found during a search for them one night. I found a bunch more fractals that weren’t particularly remarkable, but then about half a year after finding the lamb, I thought, “what haven’t I tried?”, and I thought of a square root.  I tried that out with the equation I had at that moment, which was the lamb’s times two.  I saw what looked like it could be a body, and took off some layers to expose the body.  Before I had found the body I had found what looked like feet, only I hadn’t saved them.  Blessedly, it was within a few hours and so I recalled their algorithm.
</p><p> Lastly, there is something I would like to leave you with.   The Chudnovsky\Matiyasevich, Robinson, Davis, Putnam Theorem (or MRDP Theorem) proved using the Fibonacci sequence in such a way that it was shown that you can’t prove that 0=/=1 without in fact zero equalling one.
</p><p></p><p>
P.S. As to the American Flag: when Manny's face first appeared he was red.  This could be an indication of the other half of the sign.  One symbol two meanings.  This seems to be representative of an internal struggle for this nation's souls.
