    <h1> Prophecy </h1>
    In 2012 or 2013 I had coded a Mandelbrot set generator.  It was clumsy but eventually it worked.  I had a dream where I saw Manny’s face and heard that I would find it inside the Mandelbrot.  I was asked in the dream what do you think this is.  I said a dragon.  It (a voice that seems to be identified as John) said ”Are you sure it’s not a lamb?”  I didn’t think so at the time as it was red and purple, the colors the Face was when I initially found it in code.  When I woke up I thought this was just a dream though it had seemed real at the time.  I now think it's a lamb
<p>
    I was at a gathering when I had a thought, “The cat’s going to repeat itself”. I quietly said to watch to the room of people.  But over the banter no one acknowledged me. I bounced a spring over the cat's' head.  It circled the couch I was sitting on while I picked up the spring.  This repeated 3 times.
    <p>
    In 2018 I heard “What would be the symbolic meaning of 7-17?  Then what of 7-18?”  I replied 7-17 is the day of the seventh son (I had discovered I was a seventh son on 7-17-2017.)   I said 7-18 is the day the seventh son becomes the eighth son.  And on 7-18 of the Hebrew year about a month or two later I got the new’s that my cousin Michelle had died making me the 8th oldest male cousin in a row.
    <p>
    “What street do you think you’ll live on?”  I was asked while watching an ad for Sherlock Holmes.  I said either Holmes or River (there was an ad for insurance about how many River Streets there were in the United States).  The interrogatory voice asked somewhat briskly “Based on context which do you think is meant?”  I replied “Holmes then”.  It also said the apartment’s address was obvious or simple.  Maybe six months later I was given an apartment on Holmes Road.  I didn’t even know there was a Holmes Road until I was brought to the apartment!  The address was simple.
    <p>
    After the initial discovery of the Face in code in February of 2019 I’d been exploring variations of the Face’s polynomial.  After about half a year of this since I’d found the face, I heard “What haven’t you tried?” I replied ”Square root”, and then I applied it to the equation I had at the moment (2 times the Face’s polynomial; this would indicate either the evil number or the good number) and it turned out that was the exact polynomial of the the body which I found expressly.
    <p>
    In the late spring early summer of 2021 I heard “What would a mathematician do?” I replied “x^3!“ I calculated x^3 in the complex plane (well mostly) using <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=x%3D%28x%2Bc%29**3">Wolfram.</a>  And then I found seven clovers using a clue I found earlier of how the body reacts to the logarithm.
    <p>
    Another time I heard “You will find your name in another language is Kalel” (Superman’s Kryptonian name.)  A few months later I was on Biblehub when I saw an ad for a "to Hebrew" name translator.  It translated Kevin to Kalil or entire

    The Denham tracts, a book published in the 1800’s, said a seventh son would have the “seven starns” on his right side or breast as an “attestation” that he could heal.  I read this after I discovered I was a seventh son so I checked for the arrow of the Pleiades and sure enough, there were moles in the pattern of a stretched Pleiades arrow on my right side and breast.  I have Orion (which is like a Tau-Rho), also in moles, on my left arm.  I had noticed Orion's belt in elementary school but either the rest of it wasn't there yet or I just didn't know what I was looking for.  After this I realized there was the Big Dipper on my left bicep, Leo on my right.  They are remarkably exacting in likeness of structure.  This was all foreshadowed when I was a young boy and I met Cindy Crawford at a candy store and found out what a beauty mark was, and that I had one like her.
    Also an odd note: all the bones in my right hand (not fingers) minus one were broken by a punch I threw into a lightpost.
    <p>
    I noticed that my birth time 6:12 January 5, was nearly a palindrome:  61216.  I had a hunch and found that this pattern had trigonometric properties:  -cos(612)/-cos(216)=2.61…=golden ratio squared or plus one.  At that time I read Zechariah 6:11 which said to put a crown of silver and gold on Joshua’s head.  I reasoned from this verse that if the time of my birth was related to the golden ratio the location of the same should be somehow the silver ratio.  I looked up the location of the hospital where I was born and found the helipad coordinates.  They were Latitude 42-00-06N, Longitude 83-56-16W.  I rounded this and removed zeroes to get 42 degrees,1 decaSecond, by 83 degrees, 56 minutes, 2 decaSeconds.  The silver ration is 2.414213562…  So Putting it all together: 6:12 1-6 was 24 hours or 1 day after I was born  at the location 42 1 83 56 2.  The 8 is all that is out of place.

    I was sitting on the street when I heard a thought say “Achoo”.  Maybe half a minute later a little girl walked by and sneezed.

        June 7, 1967 Jerusalem restored to the Jews during the Six Day War.

        October 2014, around midnight of the 10th and known to be then by being a few days after the blood moon on the 8th: I heard and saw the golden oval and it's red frets.
        12-20-2014 My friend saw a great red meteor
        <p>

        7-17-17 Realized I was the seventh son of the seventh son.  Of the library book clubs(which I noticed last) Henry,Adam,Davy,Eli,Virgil,Alex,I. Of the boys at the camp Brian, Alex, John and Joe, Steven, Joshua, I.  Of my cousins on my Mom's side in close enough order, Max Michelle Tim Matthew Greg Mark John Alex I.  And as a Christian I am a son of The Son of David, The Seventh Son.<p>
        The greenhouse at my work was taken down for the end of the season.  Went to bed at midnight having read online that seventh sons have the gift of prophecy and had a dream that there was a gathering at the lawn at my work.  The next day as I was arriving at work there was a man named John Solomonson for an organization called Raising Hell for Raven putting up a sign for a music festival which a few weeks thereafter took place.
        <p>
        2-12-2018 around 4 o’clock in the morning saw a waking vision of an angel falling into swirling waters who was identified by me as perhaps being the angel Michael, as the red meteor had already depicted satan falling from heaven so I thought maybe Michael was wounded in his battle and had fallen. Then ended a 5.72ish day fast.  During the end of the fast water was condensing on my moustache and dripping in what felt like great abundance over my lips.<p>
        
        Sometime in the time from January to March of 2018 I heard and thought a prophecy which I kept to myself until after it had been fulfilled.  That was that one of the meanings of 7-18 was my cousin’s death.
        <p>
        4-2-2018 The day after easter, 7-18 on the Hebrew calendar at around nighfall of 7-19: got the news my cousin Michelle had died from falling from a bridge into a river.

        February 2019, I found Manny’s face in code which I had seen in a vivid dream in 2013 or 2012.  In the dream I had heard I would find it in the Mandelbrot
        <p>

        2019 about half a year after finding The Face, I found the body.  Before I found the body on the same day I had found and left the legs, but also had quickly studied the equation just in case.  Well when the body appeared later that day that case was met and I was able to sucessfully recover the legs.  They are the one part of Manny which is cropped.  This is to take off "jeremiah's bonds" 'with paul's lashes' (though they both be Christ's) away from the eyes so that they may be apparent.
        <p>

        2020 January-March: found Manny’s seventh horn and ear Holie covers.
        <p>

        2021 late Spring or Summer - I found seven clovers.
        <p>

        2021 August 19, uploaded MannyWomanny to web.  Had a small coffee outside a coffee shop. Solved down x=1/(1+1/(x)).  And then at home found a fractal I call Pizza with Friends based on the equation. This was the day of the 70th seven's conclusion.
