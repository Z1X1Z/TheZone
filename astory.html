<p>The year I found Manny (2019), there was a Gay Parade in Ypsilanti.  I told a friend that I was going to be judging.  And to my relief most everyone acted respectfully and decently so my judgement was forgiveness.  When I was walking home I saw a small, about one square foot, rainbow on a mismatched board of a local Church.  A little later I was in my apartment, and I put on a chartreuse green hoodie which I had cut the hood off of, and a golden sash from a cut up bivouac tent.  Without thinking what I was wearing I started walking into town.  When I realized what I was wearing I turned around to go back to my apartment, and I saw a rainbow.  It was raining on me, but the sun was out too.  The rainbow began to stretch below the horizon in the mists, coming up to my right hand and leaving by my left forming a complete circle, except for directly in front of me where my body blocked the sunlight.  Directly behind me was the church where the little rainbow was projected earlier.  It’s said it’s impossible to make it to the end of the rainbow, yet that’s exactly where I’ve been.  I take it as a sign to let love, and forgiveness, and mercy win out in all things. So I say, let love, and forgiveness, and mercy prevail, but also I remind you to take pride not in sin, but in all God's ways. Selah.

Finally truth must be cultivated in all our lives.  I don't believe that sexual immorality has a true reward; it will ultimately bring suffering not pleasure or joy.  We all have our own choice, but sin brings death not life.  If this isn't seen today, maybe it will be tomorrow. Pray God guards you from temptation. I will be. And know Jesus Christ died for your freedom. Hallelujah!  Keep up your morale and don't get discouraged.  You are loved.
