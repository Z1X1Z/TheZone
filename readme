I hope for this message to survive so I would be not only willing, but pleased, if it found new hosts.
So if it is the year 3333 or something, and the site is down, by all means, put it up again.
If you share it or use the code just drop a link to any of the before websites as an attribution or leave this message (oh and thank The Father).
The license for GLSLsandbox, which is rehosted in part here, is MIT and found in the "js" folder.
